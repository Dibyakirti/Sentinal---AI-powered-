Sentinel: AI-Powered Offline Flower Identifier
Sentinel is a novel mobile application designed to identify flowers using machine learning — entirely offline. 
Built with privacy and accessibility in mind, it helps travelers, nature lovers, and researchers recognize plant species without relying on the internet.

Features
Offline Flower Detection: Works even in forests, trails, or remote regions.
High Accuracy: Tested to classify species like Rose and Daisy with over 90% precision.
Privacy-Safe: No data leaves the user’s phone — ever.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple image capture and prediction flow.

Tech Stack
Language: Java
ML Framework: TensorFlow Lite (.tflite model)
Android SDK: CameraX, ML Kit
IDE: Android Studio
Hardware: Android smartphones

Installation
1. Clone this repo:
git clone https://github.com/Adityagujral7003/Sentinel--Al-Powered.git
2. Open in Android Studio
3. Connect an Android device or use an emulator
4. Run the project

Problem Statement
Identifying flora in remote areas is challenging due to lack of connectivity and expert resources.
Cloud-based apps raise privacy concerns by uploading sensitive data like images and location.

Implementation Steps
1. Android App Development: Created in Android Studio with a native Java base.
2. Model Integration: Lightweight TFLite model integrated for local inference.
3. Performance Testing: Ensured speed and accuracy across devices.
4. Inference Timing: Used SystemClock.uptimeMillis() to measure processing time.

Results
> 90% classification accuracy across tested flower types.
Zero dependency on internet or cloud servers.
Seamless user experience in disconnected environments.

Future Scope-
Expand flower database for wider classification.
Integrate AR-based plant visualization.
Add multi-language support for wider accessibility.
